          <h1>About him...</h1>
          <p>
            Michael Trent Reznor (born May 17, 1965) is an American musician,
            singer, songwriter, record producer, and composer. He serves as the
            lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and principal songwriter of
            the industrial rock band <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong>, which he
            founded in 1988.

          <p>
            Reznor began his career in the mid-1980s as a member of synth-pop
            bands such as Option 30, The Innocent, and Exotic Birds. While
            assembling the earliest Nine Inch Nails recordings, Reznor was
            unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, inspired by <strong>Prince</strong>, he played all the
            instruments except drums himself. He continued in this role on most
            Nine Inch Nails studio recordings, though he has occasionally
            involved other musicians, assistants, drummers, and rhythm experts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several labels responded favorably to the demo material, and Reznor
            signed with <strong>TVT Records</strong>. Nine selections from the
            Right Track demos were unofficially released years later in 1994 as
            Purest Feeling and many of these songs appeared in revised form on
            <strong>Pretty Hate Machine</strong>, Reznor's first official
            release under the Nine Inch Nails name.

              He has contributed to the albums of artists such as Marilyn
              Manson, whom he mentored, rapper Saul Williams and Halsey.
              Alongside his wife Mariqueen Maandig and long-time Nine Inch Nails
              collaborators Atticus Ross and Rob Sheridan, he formed the
              post-industrial group How to Destroy Angels in 2009.

          <h1>Childhood...</h1>
          <p>
            Whether he’s singing songs of urban despair and sexual ambiguity
            with Nine Inch Nails or recording icy film scores for often violent
            dramas, Trent Reznor exudes a <strong>bleak, gothic air</strong>.
            But while he may seem like someone with a troubled past, his
            childhood was actually pretty normal. Growing up in
            <strong>Mercer, PA</strong>, Reznor had a childhood straight out of
            Leave It to Beaver. He went fishing with his grandfather, drank
            cherry sodas at drugstores, and watched a lot of TV. Of course, he
            also found himself searching his scalp for the mark of the beast and
            playing piano like a young savant. These stories about Reznor’s past
            definitely paint a picture of a young person struggling with his
            identity and looking for a way to
            <strong> express himself </strong>.

            <p>
              Reznor Considers His Childhood Mostly Happy. Even when he was
              going through the trauma of his parents' divorce, he was being
              well cared for. His grandparents shuttled him to piano lessons and
              stoked his burgeoning talent.

            Seeing Reznor during the '90s in all his leather, gothed-out glory
            makes it hard to imagine the singer came from rural Pennsylvania.
            While he acknowledges he had a totally normal life in his hometown,
            he was aware a better, more interesting life for him was waiting
            somewhere else. He has television and an influx of rock magazines to
            thank for that.

          <h1>Depression...</h1>
          <p>
            During the five years following the release of The Downward Spiral
            in 1994, Reznor suffered from depression; his condition was worsened
            by the <strong>death of his maternal grandmother</strong>, who had
            raised him. He began abusing alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs, and
            successfully completed rehab in 2001. He said in a 2005 Kerrang!
            interview:
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            "There was a persona that had run its course. I needed to get my
            priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working,
            I took a couple of years off, just to figure out who I was and
            working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a
            terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what
            had happened."

            In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he stated in another
            2005 interview that he is <strong>"pretty happy"</strong>.

          <h1>Bowie...</h1>
          <aside>
            <p>
              Bowie and Reznor have a bit of a
              <strong>history together</strong>, and it all started with Reznor
              listening to the rock legend's records back when vinyl was still
              at its peak. By the time Reznor was a famous musician in his own
              right, he'd become totally obsessed with Bowie. In 1995, Reznor
              would open for Bowie's Outside Tour. He'd also remix Bowie's
              <strong>"The Hearts Filthy Lesson"</strong> that same year and
              collaborate on <strong>"I'm Afraid of Americans"</strong> in 1997.

          <p>
            As Reznor worked with Bowie, he reached a fame he'd never seen
            before. Around that time, he sold more tickets than Bowie did, and
            Reznor had a difficult time coping with his new-found success,
            according to an interview he did with The Guardian. On the "Outside
            Tour," Reznor <strong>"was a mess,"</strong> he told Rolling Stone
            in 2016. Everyone was treating him differently now that he was a
            rock star, and he wasn't quite sure how to handle it all. It became
            overwhelming, and just like so many others in the business, he
            started to self-medicate.
            <strong>
              "My way of dealing with life was to numb myself with drugs and
              alcohol, because it made me feel better and more equipped to deal
              with everything" </strong
            >, Reznor said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bowie empathized — he'd gone through something similar himself — and
            he imparted some wisdom to the newly-famous rocker: "You know, there
            is a better way here, and it doesn't have to end in despair or in
            death, in the bottom," Bowie said to him. The words were exactly
            what Reznor needed to hear, though he wouldn't take it to heart for
            a while. A year later, when the artist was at his worst, Bowie's
            advice scratched at the back of his mind and, eventually, pulled him
            out of his
            <strong>self-destructive, possibly fatal, spiral</strong>.

          <h1>Soundtracks...</h1>
          <p>
            Though the majority of material released from Reznor has been under
            the Nine Inch Nails moniker, some material has been credited to
            Reznor himself, including writing, production, instrumental
            performances, and vocal contributions. Reznor has also remixed songs
            for a number of artists, including David Bowie, Queen, N*E*R*D, and
            Megadeth.
          </p>

            Along with Atticus Ross, he won the Academy Award for Best Original
            Score for <strong>The Social Network</strong> in 2010. In 2013, the
            pair won a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media
            for their soundtrack to
            <strong>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</strong>. In 2021, alongside
            Jon Batiste, they won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for the
            soundtrack for Pixar's <strong>Soul</strong>.

              Ross began working with Reznor on the latter's side project
              Tapeworm in 2002. He later worked with Reznor's band Nine Inch
              Nails, first as a programmer and producer in 2005, and became the
              only <strong>official member</strong> of the band outside of
              Reznor in 2016.

          <h1>Videogames...</h1>
          <p>
            The original music from id Software's 1996 video game
            <strong>Quake</strong> is credited to "Trent Reznor and Nine Inch
            Nails"; Reznor helped record sound effects and ambient audio, and
            the NIN logo appears on the nailgun ammunition boxes in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from the first relatively driving track, Quake is a
            predominantly ambient soundtrack, and was Reznor's first
            experimentation with the genre. He would later go on to win an
            Academy Award for his ambient soundtrack work. The music on Quake
            has been described as
            <strong>
              dark, immersive, and intended to accentuate the game's oppressive
              tone </strong
            >. The music is often called "subtle", "disturbing", and
            "hair-raising". About the soundtrack, Reznor said, "it is not music,
            it's textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff.
            We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening
            kind of thing [...] It's been fun."

          <p class="caption">Quake, id sotfware's masterpiece.</p>
          <p>
            Reznor's association with id Software began with Reznor being a fan
            of the original Doom. He reunited with
            <strong>id Software</strong> in 2003 as the sound engineer for Doom
            3, though due to "time, money and bad management", he had to abandon
            the project, and his audio work did not make it into the game's
            final release. Nine Inch Nails' 2007 major studio recording,
            <strong>Year Zero</strong>, was released alongside an accompanying
            alternate reality game. With its lyrics written from the perspective
            of multiple fictitious characters, Reznor described Year Zero as a
            concept album criticizing the United States government's current
            policies and how they will affect the world 15 years in the future.
            In July 2012, it was announced that Reznor had composed and
            performed the theme music for
            <strong> Call of Duty: Black Ops II </strong>.
